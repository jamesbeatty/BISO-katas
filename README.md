# BISO-katas

Maintain a list of the katas for the BISO program development.

## Usage

There is a text file containing the complete list of katas, or improvements, for the BISO, or Security Practices, engagement program. This list will grow as new improvements are generated, and shrink as they are completed or deprecated.

Take a look at the list (BISO-katas.txt). If you have others in mind, or are working on something listed there see "Contributing".

2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D
